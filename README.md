# NEXT Generation Deveoper Experience

This repository aims to give a lightweight example of the end-to-end developer experience tools targetting a Kubernetes based environment. We aim to integrate the following core tools:

* **Skaffold** - glue between build, test and deployment. Enabling hot-loading and other eventing capability. Utilised by [Code Cloud]() for build + deploy capability.
* **Kustomize** - templating engine, similar to [Helm], but takes a different approach of managing template generation and contextualisation
* **Minikube** - local Kubernetes cluster. Enabling us to model our "live" production-like environment as closely as possible

## Motivations

Having seen the challenges of unifying the developer workflow with the realities of the environments which eventually host their work, I've come to appreciate the tools that make this process simplier and more organic. Enabling the "leveling-up" or advancement of developer capability within the space of their operational or run-time environments. This faciliates developers to carry out a richer support role in services the applications they deploy to production, empowering them to have a more real sense of "ownership", and also simplifying the operational model of a given organisation.

I see the recent tooling coming out of the [GoogleCloudPlatform]() origanisation attempting to deliver a robust experience which will further drive the adoption of Kubernetes , consequently enalbing a simplification and unification of deployment environment interfaces.
