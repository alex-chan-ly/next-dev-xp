We can deploy the services and all of the associated resources using the available Makefile in the root of the _istio-training_ repository.

Run the following:

\`make mesh.deploy\`

Where we can ensure that services are consumable within desired bounds depending on the consumer. 

This is made possible through the Mixer componennt in Istio, which manages the policy that will be "looked up" by Envoy proxies to validate
requests are within the specified bounds of the defined limits.

Let's first apply a basic example of rate limited for the \`Rating API\`, this is done by running the following:

&nbsp;

\`kubectl apply -f deploy/workshop/08_mixer_policy\`

&nbsp;

If we then navigate to the [demo app](https://demo.training.local) and go to the waterfall application, select \`API --> Rating\`, \`Version --> v1\`.

Now we should see no \`503\` or \`429\` responses, ramp up the \`requests/s\` and lets see what happens.
`,
  two: `We've configured a rate limit of ~15 requets per 1 second window. 
  So as we approach this rate via the waterfall application, we should begin to see \`429\` responses. Which signifies we've hit the rate limit.
  
  Increase the rate limit \`maxAmount\` in the following file:

  &nbsp;

  \`deploy/workshop/08_mixer_policy/rating-rate-limit-handler.yaml\`

  &nbsp;

  reapply the configuration by running:

  &nbsp;

  \`kubectl apply -f deploy/workshop/08_mixer_policy\`

  &nbsp;

  Once again, ramp up the request rate in the waterfall app to the limit you've set. Do you see the expected behavior?
